Module 12 Challenge

I have been contracted by the editors of the fabulous food magazine, "Eat, Safe, Love". to evaluate ratings given by the UK Food Standards Agency that give various establishments across the United Kingdom and give them a food hygiene rating. My evaluation will help the magazine's journalists and food critics decide where to focus their future articles. 

First, I used the data provided in establishments.json to setup my database and Jupyter Notebook. I then updated the database based on requested modifications from the magazine editors. Including, adding a new halal restaurant that just opened in Greenwich, but hasn't been rated yet. 

I performed an exploratory analysis to answer specific questions asked by the magazine to help them find the locations that they wish to visit and the ones that they should avoid.

    1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
    2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
    3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
    4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
